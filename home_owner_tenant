Homely™ is startup aimed at allowing home owners to rent their places out to earn extra cash.  They will be operating in the US.  They need a data model and API for their business.

The model will need to contain:
Home owner accounts with the potential for multiple properties.
A calendar to track property availabilty and rental.
Renter accounts.
Staff/admin accounts.

The API should provide:
CRUD for both types of user accounts.
CRUD for home owner properties.
Property availability management.
Property reservation management.

Create a rudimentary staff front-end to trigger the API calls.

Reporting on this data will be a critical part of the business, so that should be considered in the design.

This specification is intentionally vague.  Don’t get hung up on making sure the data model captures every last detail and possibility.  The goal is a workable model and business functionality.

Once you are finished, commit your project to a Git repository and email us with the link for review. Be prepared to discuss your coding decisions.
